\section{Introduction}

This is a short document with some justification for running with favour lower troposphere on. The original reason for running with this setting was to try to minimize the effect of the higher-latitude upper level winds in the clustering procedure. However, I wondered if this was still necessary after restricting my definition of the tropics to 23N - 23S (from 30N - 30S). I believe that it is after running this sensitivity test. 

The means by which the lower troposphere is described in detail in the main document; briefly, it is achieved by weighting the contribution from above \SI{500}{hPa} less than the contribution from below. The justification for doing this is that the lower-level winds are more important for the organization of convection.

The two figures below show why favouring the lower troposphere is done. In Fig. \ref{fig:RWP_favour_on}, which is run with the current best settings, the RWPs are well defined and are not dominated by higher-level winds. The opposite is true in Fig. \ref{fig:RWP_favour_off}. In particular, in C9 and to a lesser extent C4 there is a strong signal from the high-level winds. Thus it makes sense to carry on using the favour lower troposphere setting.
